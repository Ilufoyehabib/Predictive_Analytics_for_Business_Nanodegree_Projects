# Predictive_Analytics_for_Business_Nanodegree_Projects
This repository is created to contain all the projects I carried out during my predictive analytics for business nanodegree program at Udacity.

I am pleased to say that I have completed the Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree program offered by Udacity and powered by Bertelsmann. This Technology Scholarship has really enlightened me more about how important data is in our lives and to the success of businesses. I learnt extensively about the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) which is the problem solving framework that serves as an ultimate guide for data mining activities. I was also exposed to the Methodology Map which helps to identify the best methodology for tackling business analytics problems. As a way of testing the knowledge acquired, I completed a total of 6 projects as highlighted below;

Project1(Predicting Diamond Prices)

Project2(Predicting Catalog Demand)

Project3(Creating an Analytical Dataset)

Project4(Predicting Default Risk)

Project5(AB_Test_A new Menu Launch)

Project6(Combining Predictive Techniques)

You can check out my project submissions at this git repo: https://github.com/Ilufoyehabib/Predictive_Analytics_for_Business_Nanodegree_Projects.git

This program also gave me the opportunity to add some incredible tools like Alteryx and Tableau to my tool box which were used extensively during the course of my projects.

I am highly grateful to Udacity and Bertelsmann for granting me  this great opportunity to learn and skill up. The experience was intense and impactful. I would really recommend this course for anyone who wants to gain an interesting insight to how data can be used to help make important business decisions.
